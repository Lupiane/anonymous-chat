Background & Objectives
In this challenge, you will play with an API we provide: the wagon-chat API. This API will allow you to chat and gossip with your wagon-mates ðŸ˜‰

During this exercise, you'll have to make GET and POST requests to an API code. You'll use AJAX calls to implement a dynamic chat-room where you can instantly view the latest messages and post new ones.

Specs
View logic
In the index.html file of the challenge, you'll find an HTML form #comment-form with two inputs (#your-message and #your-name). Start by coding a simple script to dynamically insert a new comment to the top of the comments' list, without reloading the page.

This is a basic DOM exercise, no AJAX involved yet! Hint: You'll have to prevent the default behavior of the form submission (using the preventDefault() method).

Code your javascript in lib/app.js.

Fetch recent messages
In the markup, you'll find a #refresh button. We want to make it show all the latest comments from everyone your batch. Implement the JS code to do this. You will have to make a GET request to the API in JS using fetch. Again, you have to read the documentation of the API to see how this request is structured and what the API will return.

Push your messages to the API
It's fun seeing the new messages without reloading all the HTML. But try refreshing your page... The comments are gone!

All your smart code is on the client-side. It does not post any data on the server for the moment. To do that, you have to enhance your javascript code by adding a POST request to send data to be stored on the API's database. Read the documentation to figure out how to build your request using fetch.

Here is an example on using fetch on the JSON Placehoder API:

const data = { name: "George", body: "Hello from Kitt" };
const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments";

fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
Auto-refresh
Time to automatically refresh your app. Get rid of that "Refresh Chat" button!

Happy chatting!
